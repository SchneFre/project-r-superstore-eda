Objective
Use your current knowledge in R, and research to learn more stuff and go beyond your current knowledge to create a comprehensive EDA for the Superstore dataset (here). Create visualizations and calculations to answer the following business questions.

Question 1: How does sales performance vary over time?
Objective: Identify monthly trends and seasonal patterns.

Tasks:

Identify which months consistently show sales peaks
Find any unusual dips in the trend line
(Optional) Calculate YOY growth rate for the most recent complete year
Suggest potential reasons for seasonal patterns
Question 2: Which product categories have the best/worst profit margins?
Objective: Identify high/low performing product categories

Tasks:

Identify which category has the thinnest margins
Calculate the profit margin difference between top and bottom categories
Suggest strategies to improve low-performing categories
Question 3: How do regional performances compare?
Objective: Compare sales distribution and profitability across regions

Tasks:

Identify which region has both high sales and high profitability
Find any regions with negative profits
Analyze if high sales always correlate with high profits
Propose regional-specific strategies based on findings
Question 4: What does customer segmentation reveal?
Objective: Identify valuable customer groups using RFM analysis

Tasks:

Calculate percentage of customers in each segment
Identify which segment generates the most revenue
Develop retention strategies for "At Risk" customers
Suggest marketing approaches for "High Spenders"
Question 5: How does shipping mode affect profitability?
Objective: Analyze cost-to-serve across shipping modes

Tasks:

Compare profit margins across shipping modes
Calculate profit per order for each shipping mode
Suggest optimal shipping strategy based on findings
Extra Challenge
Identify 3 actionable business recommendations.
Propose 2 new questions for deeper analysis.
Estimate potential financial impact of your recommendations.
Discussion Points:

How do sales trends correlate with marketing initiatives? Are there regional preferences for product categories? What operational changes could improve low-margin categories? How might customer segmentation affect inventory management?
